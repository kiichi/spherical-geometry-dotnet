# spherical-geometry-dotnet
Converted Túbal Martín's Spherical Geometry PHP Class into .NET

Original PHP Code and Copyright is there
http://tubalmartin.github.io/spherical-geometry-php/

Test results look same (This C# Version and PHP Version have good agreement)
However, it doesn't look same as what google map / Earth does.
Especially if you have dent or crossover in polygone
Don't assume it's perfect.
